this is me trying and commenting the solutions for AOC (2025)
You can read and find this challenges at https://adventofcode.com/ 
it's very fun i would recommend trying out by yourself 



CHALLENGE 1 - DONE 
-- PART ONE --
Very nice, simple challenge that tests out some knowledge about modular 
arithmetics. 
contained in: solution.c decode.c -- header: decode.h  
-- PART TWO -- 
More tricky than i expected initialy, kinda missed some times because 
of wrong count logic, i think that there is a more clean way to solve but
it was kinda funny to model the math of the completing cycles. 
contained in: solution_two.c decode_two.c -- header: decode.h  

To compile use: make, run ./solution && ./solution2 to get the answers 
you can clean the compiled binaries with make clean

Note: My makefile fucking sucks (no intermediary steps as i'm very lazy) 
so always use -B to rebuild.

CHALLENGE 2 - DONE 
-- PART ONE -- 
just verify the symmetry of a number and add to a sum in certain ranges, could solve with regex, but nah, not very interesting
to be honest, solve this with c would be hell so i just used python
-- PART TWO -- 
This i just used regex and it was even more boring, https://regex101.com/ used this site to verify my regex expressions 
-- not very much to talk about today. 

All these are in sum_patterns.py just ran it with python . 

CHALLENGE 3 - DONE
-- PART ONE -- 
solved it in a pretty brute force way, used as a way to remember go kinda cool problem that i could think in a way better way to go
about
-- PART TWO -- 
not very tricky when you think in an way... but was very very fun to do i was busy last days so gonna catch up with the others 
really liked go pretty ergonomical language even with i kinda screwed up the logic of the first part 
go build solution && ./solution for PART 1 
go build solution2 && ./solution2 for PART 2
