this is me trying and commenting the solutions for AOC (2025)
You can read and find this challenges at https://adventofcode.com/ 
it's very fun i would recommend trying out by yourself 



CHALLENGE 1 - DONE 
Very nice, simple challenge that tests out some knowledge about modular 
arithmetics, i wrote it in a very simple C script just run it with make.  
Note that the makefile fucking sucks so always use -B to rebuild.
